## About the particle configuration file

This folder contains particle configurations used to generate simulations that would mimic real life dynamic systems (e.g. sun revolving around the Earth. The general format is described as followed: each line represents a particle and a particle's information (e.g. max, position, velocity) is delimited by commas.

> MASS, x position, y position, z position, x velocity, y velocity, z velocity
